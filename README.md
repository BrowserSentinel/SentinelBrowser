# Sentinel Browser

Sentinel Browser is a privacy-focused web browser written in Python. It includes several unique features to take control of your browsing experience, avoid tracking, block ads, and keep your online activities private.

## Key Features

- *Ad Blocker* - The built-in ad blocker helps you avoid annoying ads and protects you from malicious ads containing malware or redirects. Toggle it on and off with the Ctrl+B shortcut.

- *Password Manager* - Securely save your passwords for sites and auto-fill them when you need to log in again. The passwords are stored locally only, so your data stays private. Access the password manager with Ctrl+P.

- *Panic Button* - If you need to quickly hide what you were browsing, hit F1 to open a harmless YouTube video and close all your current tabs at once. Useful if someone is peeking at your screen!

- *Tab Controls* - Open new tabs with Ctrl+N when you want to start a new browsing session. Close the current tab without losing your place with Ctrl+M.

- *Private Search* - Search directly from the address bar and use DuckDuckGo to keep your search activities protected. Just add `?` before your search term to trigger private search mode.

- *Tracker Blocking* - By default, Sentinel Browser blocks common tracking scripts and fingerprints to keep your browsing habits private.

- *HTTPS Everywhere* - Sentinel automatically uses HTTPS encryption on sites that support it to keep your connections secure.

- *No History Tracking* - Your browsing history is not stored locally or sent anywhere. Each session starts fresh for complete privacy.

- *Sentinel Cloud Browser* - Access the [Sentinel Cloud Browser](https://sentinel.x10.bz) to browse the web privately and securely from the cloud.
